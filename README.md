# Face_Mask_segmentation_Computer_Vision

Predicted and applied masks over the faces within images using CNN and image recognition algorithms. In this hands-on project, the goal was to build a system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and apply a segmentation mask on the face.
